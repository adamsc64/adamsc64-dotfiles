#######################
# Add my .bash_login file. This sets a colorized bash prompt, some reasonable
# PATH defaults, and adds Amazon Web Services scripts to the path.

# Fancy colorized terminal settings #
#####################################
# What I'm doing here is defining the environment variable that the bash shell
# uses to render its prompt. The terminal uses the first part to override its
# default window title.
#
# For informating about colors:
# https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Color_Bash_Prompt
#
# Sets the terminal title to username, hostname, and $CWD.

# Current hostname in green:
    export PS1+=" \[\e[0;35m\]\h"
# @ symbol in dark gray
    export PS1+="\[\e[30;1m\]@"
# The current working directory in green
    export PS1+="\[\e[0;32m\]\w"
# The classic $
    export PS1+=" \[\e[30;1m\]\$ "
# Reset back to normal color.
    export PS1+="\[\e[0m\]"

# Also, default ls to colorized display.

#######################
# The command line tools depend on an environment variable (EC2_HOME) to locate
# supporting libraries. You'll need to set this environment variable before you
# can use the tools. This should be set to the path of the directory into which
# the command line tools were unzipped. This directory is named
# ec2-api-tools-A.B-rrrr (A, B and r are version/release numbers), and contains
# sub-directories named bin and lib.
